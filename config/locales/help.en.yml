        Spatial Operations services is designated for process spatial data (geoprocessing)


        Are you GIS specialist or company using geoinformation systems or data?


        May be sometimes you need functional that is missing in your GIS application?
        Eg. validate geometric correctness, process a lot of data or build isolines with points.


        In this case you can use our services. Choose necessary operation or send us request for new operation.


        It is also possible to outsource geoprocessing operations for your organization.


        We work with any data formats! Service is served by skilled GIS professionals and developers.


        We understand your worry if you somehow don't want give us your spatial data (in spite of HTTPS using and [[/home/terms_of_use|terms of use]]).
        In this case you can use distorting tool that can modify spatial reference for making binding to original location became impossible.
        Also all attributes are removes.
        You can return your original spatial reference after operation completion using same tool.
        Conversion keys stores only at your computer.

        Spatial Operations services is designated for process spatial data (geoprocessing)


        The complete list of our services is shown below. Only the services below are covered by the terms of service, service level agreements, and support offerings.

        * [[/home/operation_types_help?operation_type=topology_validation|Geometry transform tool]]: You can distort your geometry using transformation tool for prevent upload geometry explicitly, and after getting results you can remove distort in same tool.

        * [[/home/operation_types_help?operation_type=transformation_tool|Geometric correctness validating]]: Geometric correctness validating for defined rules and selected geometry classes in geodatabase.

        If you want another service, you can [[/home/request_new_operation_type|request]] it describing expected its behavior. However, we takes no responsibility for immediately start discussion and development of new service.

          =====Geometry transformation actions order=====

          *Download transformation tool, open it in ArcGIS Desktop and run.

          *Select geodatabase for transformation, choose folder for distorting parameters file and run transformation.
           Warning! Keep transformation parameters file! It will be needed for reverse transformation!
           Without this file you can't return results to home state!
          *Upload geodatabase with distorted geometry to Spatial operations service.

          *Wait for service tool will end work and download results.

          *Launch reverse transformation tool.

          *Select results geodatabase, choose distorting parameters file and run tool.

          =====User uploads geodatabase, selects feature classes and geometric correctness rules. After geometric correctness validating and operation payment results can be downloaded as geodatabase. Geometric correctness errors creates in same spatial reference as validating feature classes.=====

          =====Geometric correctness validating actions order=====

          *Check that geodatabase is correct: it must has gdb format, validating feature classes must be included in feature datasets. Only feature classes including in same feature dataset can be added to geometric correctness rule.

          You can distort your data by geometry transformation tool before uploading for prevent information leak (for example if your information has trade secret)
          You can look tool description and download it [[/home/operation_types_help?operation_type=transformation_tool|here]]

          *Pack your geodatabase to zip archive.

          *If you are not registered in Spatial Operations service, sign up and sign in to service.

          *Create Geometric Correctness Validation operation, enter description for created operation.

          *Upload zip archive with geodatabase and wait when geodatabase will be analyzed (page reloads automatically every 10 seconds).

          *After successful analyse you can go to geometric correctness rules creation. If analyzing failed, check your geodatabase and zip archive and upload it again.

          *Add new rule, select feature dataset, add coordinates comparison sensitivity if necessary

          *Select first feature class

          *Select geometric correctness rule

          *Select second feature class if rule is for two classes

          *Add created rule

          *Add another rules if necessary. If you found that some of your rules are wrong or unnecessary, You can remove them and create other.

          *When all rules will created, go to geometric correctness validation.

          *At geometric correctness validation confirmation page You can see operation parameters (cost, used rules and feature classes, etc). Check them all again. You can return to geometric correctness rules editing if any errors found, or launch geometric correctness validation.

          *After geometric correctness validation launching wait for operation done (page reloads automatically every 10 seconds). The more complex your geometry and the more geometric correctness rules, the longer they are validated.

          *After successful operation completion it must be paid for its results availability.

          *Geometric correctness validation results will be available as zip archive with geodatabase. Geometric correctness errors locates in same feature datasets and has same spatial reference that validated feature classes.
