After geometric correctness validating and operation payment results can be downloaded as geodatabase. Geometric correctness errors creates in same spatial reference as validating feature classes."

        action_1: "Check that geodatabase is correct: it must has gdb format, validating feature classes must be included in feature datasets. Only feature classes including in same feature dataset can be added to geometric correctness rule."

        action_14: "At geometric correctness validation confirmation page You can see operation parameters (cost, used rules and feature classes, etc). Check them all again. You can return to geometric correctness rules editing if any errors found, or launch geometric correctness validation."
        action_15: "After geometric correctness validation launching wait for operation done (page reloads automatically every 10 seconds). The more complex your geometry and the more geometric correctness rules, the longer they are validated."
        action_16: "After successful operation completion it must be paid for its results availability."
        action_17: "Geometric correctness validation results will be available as zip archive with geodatabase. Geometric correctness errors locates in same feature datasets and has same spatial reference that validated feature classes."
