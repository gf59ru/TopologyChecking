        short_description: "Validate topology rules in geodatabase"
        full_description: "User uploads geodatabase, selects feature classes and topology rules. After topology validating and operation payment results can be downloaded as geodatabase. Topology errors creates in same spatial reference as validating feature classes."
        actions_order: "Topology validating actions order"
        action_1: "Check that geodatabase is correct: it must has gdb format, validating feature classes must be included in feature datasets. Only feature classes including in same feature dataset can be added to topology rule."
        action_2: "Pack your geodatabase to zip archive."
        action_3: "If You are not registered in Spatial Operations service, sign up and sign in to service."
        action_4: "Create Topology Validation operation, enter description for created operation."
        action_5: "Upload zip archive with geodatabase and wait when geodatabase will be analyzed (page reloads automatically every 10 seconds)."
        action_6: "After successful analyse You can go to topology rules creation. If analyzing failed, check your geodatabase and zip archive and upload it again."
        action_7: "Add new rule, select feature dataset, add coordinates comparison sensitivity if necessary"
        action_8: "Select first feature class"
        action_9: "Select topology rule"
        action_10: "Select second feature class if rule is for two classes"
        action_11: "Add created rule"
        action_12: "Add another rules if necessary. If You swa that some of your rules are wrong or unnecessary, You can remove them and create other."
        action_13: "When all rules will created, go to topology validation."
        action_14: "At topology validation confirmation page You can see operation parameters (cost, used rules and feature classes, etc). Check them all again. You can return to topology rules editing if any errors found, or launch topology validation."
        action_15: "After topology validation launching wait for operation done (page reloads automatically every 10 seconds). The more complex your geometry and the more topology rules, the longer they are validated."
        action_16: "After successful operation completion it must be paid for its results availability."
        action_17: "Topology validation results will be available as zip archive with geodatabase. Topology errors locates in same feature datasets and has same spatial reference that validated feature classes."
